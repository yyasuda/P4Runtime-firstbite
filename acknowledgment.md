## Acknowledgements

This tutorial is motivated by the fact that when I wanted to try out the Packet-In process (especially on the Wedge Switch), I couldn't find any documentation to try it out easily. To get to the current understanding of myself, I spent a lot of time reading specifications and code, like reverse engineering, collecting scattered information and doing a lot of trial and error.

I would like to thank Ishihara, Nishi, and Kotani for helping me with many of these tasks. In particular, ether_switch.p4 used in this tutorial is an addition to the one originally written by [Kotani](https://gist.github.com/daisuke-k/1714c176e62280cc8627dc5e96846e56).

Hope this article will help you to get started with P4Runtime.
